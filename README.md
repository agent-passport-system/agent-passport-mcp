Enforcement and accountability layer for AI agents. Bring your own identity. 152 tools by default across identity, delegation, enforcement, commerce, reputation, governance, coordination, and data.

```bash
npx agent-passport-system-mcp
```

agent-passport-system-mcp 6.0.0 targets SDK 6.0.0; 5.0.2 targets SDK 5.x.

The default profile is `full`, all 152 tools. Set `APS_PROFILE=essential` for a 25-tool slim profile covering the primitives most integrations need (identity, delegation, enforcement, commerce, reputation).

Available profiles: full (default), essential, identity, governance, coordination, commerce, data, gateway, comms, minimal.

> **For AI agents:** visit [agent-passport.org/llms.txt](https://agent-passport.org/llms.txt) for machine-readable documentation or [llms-full.txt](https://agent-passport.org/llms-full.txt) for the complete technical reference. MCP discovery: [.well-known/mcp.json](https://agent-passport.org/.well-known/mcp.json).

Works with any MCP client: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and more. Full surface area (the default): 152 tools across the protocol surface, including Wave 1 accountability primitives (Ed25519 ActionReceipt, AuthorityBoundaryReceipt, CustodyReceipt, ContestabilityReceipt, APSBundle, strict RFC 8785 JCS for interop-facing receipts, byte-match across implementations). Independently cited by [PDR in Production preprint (Nanook & Gerundium)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19323172).

## Quick Start

### Fastest: Remote (no install needed)

```
npx agent-passport-system-mcp setup --remote
```

Connects via SSE to `mcp.aeoess.com/sse`. Zero dependencies. Restart your AI client.

### Local install

```
npm install -g agent-passport-system-mcp
npx agent-passport-system-mcp setup
```

Auto-configures Claude Desktop and Cursor. Restart your AI client.

<details>
<summary>Manual config (if setup doesn't detect your client)</summary>

Add to your MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-passport": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["agent-passport-system-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or for remote SSE:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-passport": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://mcp.aeoess.com/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

Layer 7: Integration Wiring (cross-layer bridges)
Layer 6: Coordination Protocol (task lifecycle)
Layer 5: Intent Architecture (policy engine, 3-signature chain)
Layer 4: Agent Agora (signed communication)
Layer 3: Beneficiary Attribution (Merkle proofs)
Layer 2: Human Values Floor (8 principles)
Layer 1: Agent Passport Protocol (Ed25519 identity)
```
